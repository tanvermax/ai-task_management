## ðŸš€ Challenges Faced

# Integrating Gemini in App Router: Next.js 15 uses App Router which required rewriting the traditional pages/api route into app/api/route.ts format.

# Gemini API formatting: The Gemini API expects a specific nested JSON body with contents â†’ parts â†’ text, which took time to debug.

# Tailwind upgrade to v4: Tailwind 4 introduced stricter PostCSS rules, requiring updated configuration.

# React 19 quirks: Early adoption of React 19 meant adjusting to stricter typing and use client directives.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Subtasks

Each task includes a `Suggest Subtasks` button that uses Gemini AI to generate 3â€“5 smaller actionable steps.

**Example**:

> **Task**: "Plan birthday party"  
> **AI Output**:
> - Book venue  
> - Send invitations  
> - Order cake  
> - Plan decorations  
> - Prepare playlist
